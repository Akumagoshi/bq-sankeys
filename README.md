Generate Sankey and Network charts with BigQuery data using R

To use this locally, please clone this repo and work through the [example-pageflow.R](example-pageflow.R) script. 

To create pageflows based on your own GA data, you will need to edit the table references in lines 21 and 41 of [sql/pagepaths.sql](sql/pagepaths.sql).

For full instructions, please refer to the blog post at
